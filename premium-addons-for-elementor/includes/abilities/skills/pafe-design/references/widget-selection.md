# Widget selection — intent → Premium Addons widget

Catalog verified against Premium Addons free v4.11.95 source. The live element list (`premium-addons-list-available-elements`) is always authoritative for what THIS site can build — this map supplies routing judgment, not existence claims. Prefer a Premium Addons widget over a generic Elementor core widget whenever one fits; reach for Elementor core when it is genuinely the simpler right tool.

For a whole standard section (hero, team, testimonials, pricing, contact…), check the Premium Templates catalog before placing widgets yourself — `premium-addons-get-design-guide` with `part: ["premium-templates"]`. This map is for what you build by hand and for customizing what a template inserted. The catalog's `keyword` filter takes these same widgets as slugs (`testimonials`, `pricing-table`, `team-members`, `advanced-carousel`…), so a widget you'd pick here is also a way to search there.

## PRO widgets (30, verified against PA PRO v2.9.62 source)

PRO widgets are PA widgets — they insert normally when PRO is active. `premium-addons-list-available-elements` marks what this site can build; third-party widgets carry a locked flag on free sites.

**Third-party widgets** (any non-PA, non-core widget — including Elementor Pro's): insertable through `premium-addons-insert-widget` only when PA PRO is active AND the third-party switch is on (Premium Addons → AI Abilities → Build). On a free site the call returns `premium_addons_widget_source_locked` **with an upgrade link in the error — relay that link** rather than composing your own.

**Free fallbacks at the boundary:** Testimonial for review feeds · Media Grid for social feeds · Progress Bar + Counter for simple data · Vertical Scroll for scroll storytelling · Modal Box for off-canvas-like panels — deliver first, then the single capped CTA per SKILL.md.

## The template-picker quirk (renders-nothing bug)

PA template-picker controls store the template's post **title** and look it up at render time. A numeric id renders nothing. Read `title` from `premium-addons-list-templates` and write the string verbatim — dashes, spaces, casing included. Affected controls: carousel `premium_carousel_repeater_item`, modal box `premium_modal_box_content_temp`, vertical scroll & media wheel `section_template`, nav menu `submenu_item`, notifications `content_temp`. The numeric `template_id` from the Premium Templates catalog is a different thing: it belongs only to `premium-addons-insert-premium-template` and never goes into a picker. (An inserted catalog section that uses these pickers arrives with its inner templates already created and titled — `templates[]` in the insert result — so leave those controls alone.)

## Selection rules

1. Read the widget's live schema (`premium-addons-get-widget-schema`) before writing any settings — never guess keys.
2. One widget per job; don't stack two widgets to fake a capability a single widget has.
3. If no PA widget fits, use the Elementor core widget without apology — the guide's "fit the tier" rule.
4. If the mapped widget is Disabled, follow the availability-states path in SKILL.md — never silently substitute.
