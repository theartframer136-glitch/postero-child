## Effect vocabulary — loose language → precise addon

You cannot select an effect you cannot name. Translate first:

| The user says…                                                      | They mean                  | Tier |

## Application rules

1. **Motivated, not decorative.** The design guide owns the motion rules: effects only for hierarchy, feedback, or state; a static page is complete; honor reduced-motion. One signature effect used sparingly beats five effects used everywhere.
2. **Free fallbacks at the PRO boundary:** Parallax → a fixed-attachment background or Floating Effects on a foreground element; Particles → Shapes or an on-palette Lottie via the free Lottie Animations widget; Badge → a positioned Heading; Magic Scroll → entrance animations. Deliver the fallback first, then the single capped CTA per SKILL.md.
3. **Performance:** effects on many elements multiply cost. Prefer one container-level effect over per-widget repetition; mention `premium-addons-clear-dynamic-assets` after large changes.
